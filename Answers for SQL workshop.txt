Car
	>1,082 movies listed as containing the word 'car'

	SELECT COUNT(name) FROM movies WHERE year = 1985;

1982

	SELECT actors.first_name, actors.last_name 
	FROM actors 
	JOIN roles ON actors.id = roles.actor_id 
	JOIN movies ON roles.movie_id = movies.id 
	WHERE movies.name = "Braveheart" 
	ORDER BY actors.last_name ASC;
